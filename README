What is this?
	This is IRC logging service, made of 2 separate modules: logger.rb, which logs IRC and dumps needed stuff to MySQL database and viewer.rb, which is front-end for viewing entries in database. viewer.rb is made on sinatra and runs on thin webserver. If you have needed guts, you can migrate code to something other.

Requirements:
	MySQL MyISAM database (InnoDB has no fulltext search compatibility, sorry)
	Ruby 1.9.3
	Gems: bundler net-yail sinatra date sequel mysql2
	Linux/FreeBSD (both tested)
	~100MB RAM free

Basic configuration:
	Setup everything at irclogger/config
	Import schema.sql to your database
	Change hardcoded greetings and title at irclogger/views/*.haml
	Setup your analytics if needed at irclogger/views/_analytics.erb
	Test run your logger by launching launch-logger.sh, if something bad happens, bot will respawn and dump trace to irclogger/log/logger.log. Dont do this at public IRC channels, because if cause of respawn is recursive, you will end with 10-15 bots on channel
	If everything is OK with logger, launch viewer with launch-viewer.sh
	Test your viewer, usualy, theres nothing where something can go wrong
	Enjoy!
